## ESnet SmartNIC Hardware Design Repository

This repository contains the hardware design directory for the ESnet SmartNIC platform.

The ESnet SmartNIC Platform is based on the AMD (Xilinx) OpenNIC Shell, which provides
an FPGA-based NIC shell with 100Gbps Ethernet ports, and runs on the AMD (Xilinx) Alveo family
of hardware boards.  More information about the OpenNIC shell can be found at:
https://github.com/esnet/open-nic-shell

The ESnet SmartNIC platform implements a P4-programmable packet processing core within the
OpenNIC shell.  The P4 processor is implemented with the AMD (Xilinx) VitisNetP4 IP core.
More information about the VitisNetP4 core is available at the AMD (Xilinx) Vitis Networking
P4 Secure Site (once access privileges are approved and granted).  Further questions can be
directed to vitisnetp4@xilinx.com.

The SmartNIC platform provides the necessary hardware datapath and control features
to operate the custom VitisNetP4 processor core.

The `esnet-smartnic-hw` repository includes the RTL source files, verification test suites
and build scripts for compiling a user P4 file into a downloadable bitfile, as well as the
software artifacts necessary for seamless integration with the SmartNIC runtime firmware,
which is located in a companion github repository at:
https://github.com/esnet/esnet-smartnic-fw

The OpenNIC shell and SmartNIC designs are built with the AMD (Xilinx) Vivado software tool
suite.  The current release supports development with Vivado version 2023.1, running on
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.  Furthermore, while the ESnet SmartNIC Platform, the AMD (Xilinx) OpenNIC
shell and the AMD (Xilinx) Vivado tool suite are all public and openly available, note
that the AMD (Xilinx) VitisNetP4 IP core is a commercially licensed feature that requires a
site-specific license file.

The ESnet SmartNIC platform is made available in the hope that it will
be useful to the networking community. Users should note that it is
made available on an "as-is" basis, and should not expect any
technical support or other assistance with building or using this
software. For more information, please refer to the LICENSE.md file in
each of the source code repositories.

The developers of the ESnet SmartNIC platform can be reached by email
at smartnic@es.net.

## Getting Started

### Installing the SmartNIC Hardware Design Repository

The following steps guide a new user through the installation of the
SmartNIC Hardware Design Repository, beginning with a
suitably-configured host running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Linux.

1. Install the esnet-smartnic-hw respository by creating a clone from github into a local directory:

       > git clone https://github.com/esnet/esnet-smartnic-hw.git


2. Initialize all submodules within the esnet-smartnic-hw/ design directory:

       > cd esnet-smartnic-hw
       > git submodule update --init --recursive


3. Install the prerequisites required to run the esnet regio tools:

       > sudo apt install python3-yaml python3-jinja2 python3-click
       > pip3 install -r esnet-fpga-library/tools/regio/requirements.txt

   Note: The above instructions and more details about the `regio` tools can be found in the README file
   at: `esnet-fpga-library/tools/regio/README.md`


### Installing and Configuring the Vivado Runtime Environment

1. Install the AMD (Xilinx) Vivado tool suite, including the VitisNetP4 option.

2. Configure the runtime environment by executing the settings64.sh script located in the Vivado
installation directory:

       > source /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2023.1/settings64.sh

   where the Vivado installation directory is located at /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2023.1/ in this example.

3. Set the XILINXD_LICENSE_FILE environment variable accordingly to resolve the site-specific license for
the AMD (Xilinx) VitisNetp4 IP core.  This can be done with a `.flexlmrc` file in the users home directory,
or in a BASH script file (such as a `.bashrc` in the users home directory).  The example BASH shell
command is:

       > export XILINXD_LICENSE_FILE=<filename>

### Building the SmartNIC p4_only Example Design

Build the `p4_only` example design by executing the p4_only application Makefile.
From the esnet-smartnic-hw directory:

       > cd examples/p4_only
       > make

   Upon completion, the above step creates an artifact zipfile with the default pathname:
   `artifacts/<BUILD_NAME>/artifacts.<BOARD>.<BUILD_NAME>.0.zip`

   This artifact zipfile contains all of the necessary h/w artifacts to integrate with the firmware.
   In addition to the bitfile, it includes firmware driver files, regmap yaml files, the source p4 file,
   and any wireshark .lua files.

   For more details about the `p4_only` design, as well as simulating the P4 program,  refer to
   `examples/p4_only/README.md`.


### Building a New P4 Application

The following steps can be taken by a new user to setup a local application design directory for building
the bitfile and artifacts for a custom P4-based SmartNIC application.

1. Install the esnet-smartnic-hw respository (as described above).

   Or, alternatively, add the esnet-smartnic-hw respository to an existing git repository as a sub-module:

       > git submodule add https://github.com/esnet/esnet-smartnic-hw.git

2. Initialize all submodules within the esnet-smartnic-hw/ design directory:

       > cd esnet-smartnic-hw
       > git submodule update --init --recursive

3. Install Vivado and configure the runtime environment (as described above).

4. Return  to the local application design directory and then copy the example SmartNIC application Makefile and p4/ sub-directory into the local application design directory:

       > cd ../
       > cp esnet-smartnic-hw/examples/p4_only/Makefile ./
       > cp -r esnet-smartnic-hw/examples/p4_only/p4 ./

5. Using a preferred editor, edit the copied Makefile to update the SMARTNIC_DIR environment variable assignment as follows:

       #SMARTNIC_DIR := ../..
       SMARTNIC_DIR := $(CURDIR)/esnet-smartnic-hw

6. Copy the application p4 file to the following location and filename:

       > cp <p4_filename> p4/`basename $PWD`.p4

     Note: By default, the SmartNIC scripts take the basename of the application design directory to be the name of the application, as well as its associated filenames.

7. Build the design by executing the copied application Makefile:

       > make

8. To simulate the P4 program, refer to the readme file provided in the p4/sim/ directory i.e. `p4/sim/README.md`




## P4 Programming Requirements

The P4 processing core of the SmartNIC platform is implemented with the AMD (Xilinx) VitisNetP4 IP core.
In order to meet the requirements of the VitisNetP4 IP core and the SmartNIC platform, a new P4 program should
consider the following guidelines.


### AMD (Xilinx) P4 Architecture:

The Vitis Networking P4 compiler supports a specific pipelined datapath architecture that is comprised of 3
customizable stages: A Parser Engine, followed by a Match-Action Engine, followed by a Deparser Engine.
User P4 files **MUST** be structured to comply with this processing architecture, and specify the custom operations
desired within each of these processing stages.

More details about the AMD (Xilinx) P4 architecture can be found in the *Vitis Networking P4 User Guide, UG1308
(v2023.1) May 16, 2023*.


### Include files:

The P4 program **MUST** include the following AMD (Xilinx) VitisNetP4 include files:

      #include <core.p4>
      #include <xsa.p4>

These files capture built-in constructs and the standard definitions for the AMD (Xilinx) P4 architecture.
They are located in the Vivado installation directory at:
`$XILINX_VIVADO/data/ip/xilinx/vitis_net_p4_v1_1/include/p4/`


### Interfaces:

The P4 processing core supports 3 types of interfaces:

- *Packet Ports* are the primary interfaces responsible for moving packets in and out of the core, as well as
between engines.  Engines can only contain a single input packet port and a single output packet port.

- *Metadata Ports* carry sideband data related to a packet. Metadata can only correspond to a single packet
and is processed in parallel with the packet.  More on Metadata below.

- *Register IO Ports (axi4l)* are used to control the contents of the Look-up engines.


### Metadata Definitions:

The VitisNetP4 core supports both `Standard Metadata` (defined and set by the P4 core), and `User Metadata`
(defined and set by the SmartNIC platform).  Both types of metadata can be read and/or written by the P4
program.

For more details about the `Standard Metadata` definitions, see *Vitis Networking P4 User Guide, UG1308
(v2023.1) May 16, 2023*.

In order for the compiled VitisNetP4 core to match the SmartNIC application interface, a user P4 program **MUST**
define the User Metadata structure as follows:

    struct smartnic_metadata {
        bit<64> timestamp_ns;    // 64b timestamp (in nanoseconds). Set at packet arrival time.
        bit<16> pid;             // 16b packet id used by platform (READ ONLY - DO NOT EDIT).
        bit<3>  ingress_port;    // 3b ingress port (0:CMAC0, 1:CMAC1, 2:HOST0, 3:HOST1).
        bit<3>  egress_port;     // 3b egress port  (0:CMAC0, 1:CMAC1, 2:HOST0, 3:HOST1).
        bit<1>  truncate_enable; // reserved (tied to 0).
        bit<16> truncate_length; // reserved (tied to 0).
        bit<1>  rss_enable;      // reserved (tied to 0).
        bit<12> rss_entropy;     // reserved (tied to 0).
        bit<4>  drop_reason;     // reserved (tied to 0).
        bit<32> scratch;         // reserved (tied to 0).
    }

### Lookup Engines and Externs:

In order for the compiled VitisNetP4 core to match the SmartNIC application
interface, a user Program **MUST** have:

- One (or more) Look-up Engines.
- No HBM BCAMs.
- No Externs.

Support for these features may be added in a future release.


### Reference Documents:

The following reference documents can be accessed from the AMD (Xilinx) Vitis Networking P4 Secure Site
(once access priveleges are approved and granted):
